        I am a sophomore from Saint Louis, majoring in Computer Science 
        and Engineering with minors in Engineering Corporate Practice 
        and Accountancy. Therefore, I am interested in both technological
         and consulting opportunities. In my spare time, I code the 
        Apogee Control System (ACS) for the Notre Dame Rocketry 
        Team and break down science and engineering principles to 
        students in the South Bend community through my role as 
        Educational Outreach Lead. In the real world, I hope to produce similar results--providing physical solutions to problems through problem-solving and engineering.
